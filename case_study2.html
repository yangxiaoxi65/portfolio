            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>To inform the design and functionality of the Movie Recommender, a competitive analysis was conducted on three popular movie websites: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">IMDb</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/" target="_blank">Metacritic</a>. The analysis focused on several key aspects:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Filtering Options:</strong> Allow users to filter movies based on genre, release year, or rating.</li>
                <li><strong>Sorting Capabilities:</strong> Enable users to sort movies by release date, rating, or popularity.</li>
                <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Interface should be intuitive, with clear navigation and logical information layout.</li>
                <li><strong>Movie Information Presentation:</strong> Provide detailed and easy-to-understand information, such as plot summary, cast list, and ratings.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Features:</strong> Allow users to interact and share information via reviews, ratings, and social media.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Based on the analysis, several key insights were gained:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IMDb excels in providing comprehensive filtering options, detailed movie information, and social features but could improve its user experience due to an overwhelming interface for some users.</li>
                <li>Rotten Tomatoes offers a clean and intuitive user interface with effective sorting capabilities and social features but lacks in-depth movie information.</li>
                <li>Metacritic provides detailed movie information and reviews but falls short in filtering options, social features, and overall user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These insights were incorporated into the design and development of the Movie Recommender application, aiming to combine the strengths of each website while addressing their weaknesses.</p>
