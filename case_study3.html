        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project aimed to redesign and improve the website onboarding flow of Allara Health, a virtual care provider specializing in women's hormonal and metabolic health. Our team created a new interactive prototype focused on enhancing user clarity, personalization, and trust.

        <h2>Context and Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Allara Health's original website presented challenges for potential patients, leaving them uncertain about its suitability. Specific issues included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lack of clear messaging about Allara's services</li>
          <li>Unfamiliarity with Allara's offerings</li>
          <li>Patients' skepticism of doctors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I took the lead in gathering initial research and worked on identifying these core issues by analyzing user behavior and feedback.

      <section id="goal">
        <h2>Research and Project Goals</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to redesign the Allara website to address key issues faced by potential patients. These issues included uncertainty about Allara's services, lack of brand awareness, and skepticism towards healthcare providers. The redesign aimed to clarify Allara's offerings, build trust with patients, and effectively communicate the benefits of choosing Allara for their healthcare needs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve clarity about Allara's unique services and suitability for patients</li>
          <li>Build trust with patients by showcasing the doctors and personalizing their experience</li>
          <li>Simplify the onboarding process to reduce friction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I helped refine the project goals by communicating with the client to clarify patient onboarding requirements and potential pitfalls in the original flow.

        <h2>Solution - Interactive Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          We addressed the identified issues through a series of iterations, refining our solution to produce an intuitive and effective onboarding flow.
